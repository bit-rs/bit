#### What is Bit?

Bit is a *lightweight, dynamic, safe and concurrent programming language* designed to be simple, flexible, and fast.  
Experiment freely, code fast, and launch your ideas into orbit  

Think of Bit as your *satellite in the programming universe*: lightweight, mobile, and ready to orbit wherever you need it 💫.

#### Status

Bit is currently a **work in progress (WIP)** ⚙️.  
Nightly builds are available and can be run on **stable Rust**, giving you a chance to explore and test the language as it evolves.

#### Quick Start

**Hello, world!**
```bit
println("Hello, world! 🌟");
```
